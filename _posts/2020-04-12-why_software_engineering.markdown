I have an educational and work background in healthcare administration, but I chose to pursue software engineering because I want to make a career change. My educational experience is diverse, and each degree is unrelated to the previous one. I have a bachelor’s degree in Pre-Law and Political Science and a master’s degree in Healthcare Administration. Frustration is the main reason I decided to pursue software engineering. I have been continuously frustrated with the jobs that I have held. All of the jobs in Healthcare Administration require five to seven years of experience and without an employer willing to hire me I can not obtain that experience. As a result, I decided to do some research on possible career changes. I never considered getting involved in this field, but the industry continues to have career opportunities, and the job outlook for software developers is projected to increase until 2028. After conducting some research, I discovered the Career Karma App. The Career Karma App linked me with several other professionals looking to get into coding. The app was the first time that I learned about coding boot camps. I explored the available programs and specialization options and decided to enroll in Flatiron’s part-time software engineering program. Also, although I am nervous about this embarking on this new journey, for 2021, I am hoping to be at a new job and finally feeling fulfilled with my career.
